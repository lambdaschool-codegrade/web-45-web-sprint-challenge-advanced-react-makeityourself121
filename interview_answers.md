# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

    Stateful components are keeping track of changing data, while stateless components print out what is given to them via props, or they always render the same thing.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

     ComponentWillMount is called before the render function. ComponentWillUpdate is called right before the component renders and right after shouldComponentUpdate.

3. Define stateful logic.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?
